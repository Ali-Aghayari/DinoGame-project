# **Arduino Servo and Color Detection System**

This project uses an Arduino board to control a servo motor based on color detection using a sensor. The system calibrates the color detection threshold by detecting white and black colors, and adjusts the servo motor accordingly. An LCD display provides feedback to the user, such as the calibration status and countdown timer.

## **Features**
- **LCD Display**: Displays messages and countdowns for color calibration.
- **Servo Motor Control**: Moves the servo between two angles based on the detected color intensity.
- **Color Calibration**: Calibrates the system by setting the white and black color intensities.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides feedback on the LCD display during the calibration process.

## **Hardware Required**
- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- **Servo Motor**
- **LCD Display** (16x2 LCD recommended)
- **Color Sensor** (for detecting white and black surfaces)
- Jumper wires and a breadboard

## **Libraries Used**
- **LiquidCrystal**: To control the LCD display.
- **Servo**: To control the servo motor.

## **Code Overview**
1. **Servo Motor Control**: The servo motor's angle is adjusted between two predefined positions based on the color detected (white or black).
2. **LCD Display**: Displays a countdown and messages for user interaction during calibration.
3. **Color Calibration**: The user sets the white color intensity, and the system stores this value for future comparisons.

---

## **How It Works**
1. The system starts by prompting the user to set the white color intensity.
2. The user has a fixed time to position a white surface in front of the sensor.
3. Once calibrated, the servo's position is adjusted based on the detected color intensity (moving to one of two predefined angles for white and black surfaces).

## **Usage**
1. Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the hardware (LCD, servo, and color sensor) to the Arduino as per the wiring diagram.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to see the outputs and feedback from the system.
